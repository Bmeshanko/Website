								<h1>Prime Warzone Bot</h1>
								<p>
                                    Before diving into explaining a Warzone Bot, it would be helpful to the reader to understand how the game works: 
                                    <a href="https://www.warzone.com/About">https://www.warzone.com/About</a><br><br>

                                    Prime is a project that I initially started in the Summer of 2021.<br>

                                    It is currently on its 3rd iteration, and finally lived up to expectations. Prime is now capable of:
                                    <li>Intelligent, weighted picking</li>
                                    <li>Efficient expansion beyond just initial bonuses</li>
                                    <li>Unpredictable attacks difficult for humans to handle</li><br>

                                    Currently, it would be fair to say that Prime is the 2nd best non-human player in the world. It is capable of 
                                    defeating both versions of the production bot, as well as several other external bots:
									<li>Prod 1.0: <a href="https://www.warzone.com/MultiPlayer?GameID=33220618">
										https://www.warzone.com/MultiPlayer?GameID=33220618</a></li>
									<li>Prod 2.0: <a href="https://www.warzone.com/MultiPlayer?GameID=33222360">
										https://www.warzone.com/MultiPlayer?GameID=33222360</a></li><br>

                                    This animation displays Prime's ability to simultaneously expand and break into bonuses of the opponent.
                                    The example shows an income swing of 7, which is very often game-deciding.<br>
                                    <span class="image">

                                    </span><br>
                                    Prime was developed in C# using the Warzone.AI framework. The project is over 1,500 lines of code and features 
                                    several algorithms to evaluate its decisions.<br><br>

                                    The Bot will continue to be updated and improved throughout 2023 and is hosted on GitHub:
