								<h1>Angular.js Trivia Website</h1>
								<p>
                                    In the Spring 2023 Semester, I created a trivia website to help me practice both my geography knowledge and
									my full-stack development. Since GitHub Pages is incompatible with the Node.js backend, I cannot host it here.<br><br>

									One of the most common development stacks is called MEAN. A MEAN development stack consists of:<br>
									<b>M</b>ongoDB - Database<br>
									<b>E</b>xpress.js - Library to implement Server<br>
									<b>A</b>ngular.js - Front-end<br>
									<b>N</b>ode.js - Backend Language<br><br>
									However, I used <u>PostgreSQL</u> instead of MongoDB as my database, since it is incredibly simple and 
									easy to host locally. Here is what the interface looks like:<br>
								</p>
								<span class="image">
									<img src="images/trivia.png" width="1200">
								</span><br><br>
								<p>
									Angular is a commonly used front-end framework for designing Single-Page Applications (SPAs) such as this.
									I set up a simple PostgreSQL database that runs on my local machine that the Node/Express backend can access
									through standard HTTP protocol. The Frontend is also able to make queries to the API generated by the backend.
									<br><br>
									The game involves choosing two countries at random and choosing a category. The player
									will then choose the country with a higher value of that category (area, gdp, population). There is also a mode
									that involves choosing which country has the selected capital. The score will continuously count until it is recorded
									or the page is refreshed.
									<br><br>
									My biggest takeaway from the project is that I made the game too easy. Guessing whether the USA or Vatican City
									has a higher population is not exactly challenging. Further editions of the game will choose countries that are within
									a certain percentage of each other. I have made an updated version of this game that uses text input and a picture of the flag.
									Not worthy of front-page real estate, but I still made a page for it:
									<br>
									<a href="flags.html">Flag Guesser</a>
									<br><br>
									The relevant frontend/backend files can be found on GitHub (as it is quite tedious to place the whole project there):
