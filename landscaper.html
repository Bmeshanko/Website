								<h1>Travelling Landscaper Cloud Project</h1>
								<p>
                                    For my CS351 Cloud Computing course, we were assigned an open-ended course project, allowing essentially
                                    anything related to the Cloud. People wrote research papers, built personal Cloud-gaming services, and 
                                    almost anything imaginable. I wanted to use Google Maps APIs to implement the famous Travelling Salesman
                                    Problem and apply it to my previous summer job: designing an optimized landscaping route.
                                    <br><br>
                                    There were four stages of the software pipeline to turn a list of 40 addresses into two lists of correctly
                                    ordered routes:<br>
                                    <li>Convert the Addresses to Lat/Long Coordinates using Google Cloud Platform's (GCP's) Geocoding API.</li>
                                    <li>K Means Clustering algorithm to generate the geometric center, which is then used to form two clusters
                                        that contain half of the addresses.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Generate 2 separate distance matrices using GCP's Distance Matrix API.</li>
                                    <li>Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem for both of the two distance matrices with a Dynanmic Programming
                                        Algorithm that runs in exponential time. The algorithm will output the most efficient route.
                                    </li>
                                    <br>
                                    Here is an example of one of the routes that was generated (Source: MapQuest)
